<p>A well rounded computer science degree with the ability to study in specialized areas. The focused areas were object oriented programming, 
data structures and algorithms, and areas of study that are necessary for large scale projects (multi-threading, real-time systems, software lifecycles).</p>
<p> Some important areas/topics that were covered:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Algorithm Analysis
	</li>
	<li>Many languages: Java, C++, C, Scheme, Prolog, Perl, Assembly, Javascript</li>
	<li>Software Design processes and lifecycles</li>
	<li>Methods of efficiently testing your code (code coverage, robustness)</li>
	<li>Multi-threading, Distributed Systems, Compilers, Interrupts, Operating systems(context-switching)</li>
</ul>
<p>The degree culminates with an Honours project in an area of computer sciebce that needs some research/development. I was supervised by Professor Pat
Morin. My project was to research and create an algorithm to attempt to improve the efficiency of the javascript DOM function <code>getElementsById(tag)</code>.
