					<p>Heya! Welcome to my personal page. On this site you will find a little bit about my professional self, my education, and my career goals. Feel free
					to browse around.</p>
					
					<p>Being a new computer science graduate, I have a great deal of ambition geared towards contributing to the fast world of technology. 
					I am particularly interested in the web and mobile spaces. The lightweight, yet powerful, nature of the two is very appealing to me. The two have
					definitely shaped my life, and I hope to help further shape the direction they go in. </p>
